#### TODO

- avg, var, hf sometimes negative (dedup) ok
- comm matrices with different granularities (12 vs 21 bits on swim_m)
- move pid hashtable to real hash table


#### DONE

- crash when hash table conflict - ok, since not saving the disabled ptes anymore
- large mem usage - ok, reduced sice of pid and mem tables
- kprobes for begin and end process - ok, implemented
- locks necessary? - ok, removed all locks
- fix pte in dpf? - ok, fixed now in handle_pte_fault
- reduce size of mem hash table to 32 bits? - ok, still need 64 bit for generality


#### Performance

- pttest, 8T, parsec, native: with: 1481 secs; without: 1451 secs
